# RR evaluation and follow-up

## Deferred: transmission and refraction

- [ ] Design RR inputs for thin transmission and refracted/volume paths, including
  radiance, representative distance, surface attributes, motion and history validity.
- [ ] Check admission against the latest Native transmission implementation before
  enabling RR; do not remove unsupported-material guards without input validation.
- [ ] Evaluate glass silhouettes, objects behind glass, reflected/refracted detail,
  camera/object movement and disocclusion against a converged Native reference.

## Dynamic objects

- [ ] Add opaque translation/rotation RR scenes using the Scene35 animation mechanism.
- [ ] Verify object-motion input and history behavior independently of camera motion.
- [ ] Record whether animation resets history or supports continuous temporal reuse.
  A stable image obtained by resetting every animation frame is not proof of correct
  object motion vectors or continuous RR history.
